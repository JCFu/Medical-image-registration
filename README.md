# FAIM -- Medical-image-registration
It is a project for developing registration tools with neural networks, applicable to other image registration tasks. Code is written using `Keras` with `Tensorflow` backend. `SimpleITK` is used to read from and write to ``.nii`` or other medical image formats. All data contained in this repository is in `.npy` format. The code here is directly applicable to grey level images. For RGB images, one should modify the codes accordingly. Input should be of format `(batchsize, height, width, channel)` in 2D cases and `(batchsize, height, width, depth, channel)` in 3D cases. In both cases, the first channel will store the source image, the target image is stacked to the second channel.

Feel free to check https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09243 for more details. The project is still ongoing, more details will be released.
### An overview
The following figure is an overview of the network's work flow:

A comparison with other methods:

Deforming source image to target image:

Deforming source label to target label:

"Foldings", i.e locations where the transformation has negative Jacobian determinants in predicted deformation can be addressed either by using a hard constraint penalizaing negative Jacobian determinants in the loss function or a soft constraint by different training mechanism without changing the configuration of baseline registration network.

Effect of penalizaing negative Jacobian determinants in the predicted deformation (folding locations shown in red):
